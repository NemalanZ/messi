            Lionel Andr√©s Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoÀànel anÀàd…æes
            Ààmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), is an Argentine professional
            footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
            Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely
            regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a
            record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European
            Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team.
            Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional
            career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies,
            including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four
            UEFA Champions Leagues.
